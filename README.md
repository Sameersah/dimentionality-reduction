# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This Colab notebook explores various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to two datasets: the Iris dataset (tabular) and the MNIST dataset (image-based). The goal is to visualize and compare the performance of these techniques in reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving important relationships.

## Techniques Implemented

The following dimensionality reduction techniques are implemented and visualized in this notebook:

1. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**: Preserves local neighborhood relationships.
2. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Focuses on preserving local similarities.
3. **ISOMAP (Isometric Mapping)**: Preserves global geometry by approximating geodesic distances.
4. **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Balances local and global structure with computational efficiency.
5. **Randomized PCA**: A faster version of Principal Component Analysis.
6. **Kernel PCA**: Applies PCA in a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function.
7. **Incremental PCA**: Processes data in batches for large datasets.
8. **Factor Analysis**: Aims to identify underlying latent factors.
9. **Autoencoders**: Neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, with a bottleneck layer for dimensionality reduction.

## Datasets

- **Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset for classification, containing measurements of iris flowers.
- **MNIST Dataset**: A collection of handwritten digits commonly used for image recognition tasks.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load the datasets, apply the dimensionality reduction techniques, and visualize the results.
3. Experiment with different parameters of each technique to observe their impact on the reduced data.

## Observations and Insights

The notebook provides a comparison of the techniques based on cluster separation, preservation of data structure, computation time, and suitability for the dataset. Key observations are summarized in the notebook itself.

## Conclusion

Each dimensionality reduction technique has its strengths and weaknesses. The choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the desired outcome. This notebook provides a comprehensive overview and comparison to aid in selecting the most appropriate method for your data analysis tasks.
